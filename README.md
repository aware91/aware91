### I am a web developer who uses React.js, HTML, CSS, Node.js, SQLite, and Postgres. A beginner lever of Python and Vue.js. I started my web developer career in 2020, but have been passionate about design for years. Designing is my passion, even a simple excel spread sheet has a clean design before you publish it.
